					<p class="showMotionVideo pAlignRight">This was a little project I was asked to do for a client that wanted to present
						his metal figurines that he sclupted, to the Irish tourism board, so that they
						might consider funding them to be built to true scale in the hills of Donegal.
						<br>
						<br>
						It was a nice project to do since I was given 60fps, 2k footage to motion track
						with. The images were quite small and not shot with a good quality camera, so
						the picture blends quite abit into the hills. However, even with this unplanned
						scernario I got the project rolled out in a 24 hour window and the client was
						able to present it on time.

					It was done very quickly and is more an example of speedy work, rather than quality of work.
